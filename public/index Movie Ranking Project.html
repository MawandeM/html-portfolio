 <h3>The cabin in the woods</h3>
 <p>The film satirizes horror movie tropes, depicting horror movie monsters as interchangeable and mocking the conventions of the genre. The climax of the film serves as a commentary on horror movies as a whole, with the protagonists outwitting the organization but ultimately losing to the monsters.</p>

 <h3>Avatar: The way of Water</h3>
 <p>Jake Sully lives with his newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora. Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.</p>

 <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>
