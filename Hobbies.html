                <p> I love hiking because of the view of the landscape that I get to see at the end of the hike</p>

                <p>I go to the beach to emotionally regulate myself. The feel of the sand on my feet has a calming effect which I find to be quite grounding.</p>

                <p> I love playing with various colours in painting as they always clear up my thoughts and refreshes my thought process which allows me to see things more clearer.</p>
